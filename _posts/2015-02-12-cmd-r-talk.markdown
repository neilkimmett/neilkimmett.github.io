I've been meaning to post this here for a while. Back in October 2014 I gave my first ever conference talk. It was absolutely terrifying and absolutely exhilarating. I can't recommend it enough. I had always thought about doing some public speaking but had never quite managed to do it. But I gave it a go and I absolutely loved it. I got loads of great feedback on my talk. I met so many inspiring people, including some genuine personal heroes of mine. If you're on the fence about doing it I really encourage you to take a dive and go for it. Theres always conferences with Calls For Proposals open, for example right now there is [UIKonf](http://cfp.uikonf.com) and [iOSDevUK](https://twitter.com/iosdevuk/status/420279977469575169). Submit a proposal, whats the worst that could happen?

Anyway, on to my actual talk. I gave a lightning talk about the process of making [Cook With M&S](http://cookwithmands.com) and it features a montage of 893 selfies. If thats not enough to convince you to watch the video then I really don't know what is.
