Yesterday my friend [Norm](https://twitter.com/cackhanded) wrote [an excellent piece on the struggles of keeping on top of side projects](http://marknormanfrancis.com/weeknotes/2015-week-zero):

This really hit a nerve with me. I too am guilty of neglecting numerous ideas and side projects. I have a nasty habit of  starting something, happily hacking away on it for a bit, before getting bored and abandoning it half-finished. In just the last month I've turned down two opportunities to work on super interesting projects, citing my reason as _“I barely get enough time to work on my own side projects, so I have no time to add an extra project”_. The truth of it is I never work on my side projects, this blog included.

So, I'm going to take a leaf out of Norm's book:

I am committing to working on just two things in 2015, and if I fail I'm giving up on the whole idea of side projects and embracing the sofa sloth lifestyle.

This year I too am wiping my slate clean. I'm going to focus on 2 projects.

The first is __this blog__. I hope to write more, and I hope that by writing more I'll get better at writing. I'm not going to commit to any formal schedule, but at first I'm going to aim for at least 2 posts per month.

The second is __Weather Widget__ (working title). This is an app I started at the tail end of last summer. Its a Today widget for iOS that displays the weather for the next 24 hours. The temperature is displayed as a line graph, and the rainfall is displayed as a bar chart beneath it. Just the next 24 hours, just in your current location.

If I don't stick to this vaguest of commitments I sure would appreciate a gentle nudging from someone. Why don't you also commit to something and we can form a mutual pledge to nudge each other?

Wish me luck folks, and thank you Norm.

P.S. My first act of sprucing up this blog is adding an RSS feed. Behold: [http://kimmett.me/feed.xml](http://kimmett.me/feed.xml). I sure would love it if you added it to your feed reading service of choice.
