Today is my last day at Marks & Spencer. It's a pretty sad day, but I'm trying to stay upbeat about it. In the last 2 years I've had the opportunity to work with some unbelievably excellent people, and I don't regret a single day of my time here. When I first started I, and the rest of [Digital Labs](http://mslabs.io), was one of very few developers in the company. I've had a front row seat as the business has reorganised into product teams, adopted agile, hired a bunch of great developers and designers and really started thinking digital first. If you're looking for a new gig I really can't recommend it enough, check out the [careers page](http://www.mandsdigital.com/careers).

What's next for me then? I'm going freelance, which is simultaneously really exciting and totally terrifying. My first gig is remote working for [Move Loot](http://moveloot.com) a really awesome startup in San Francisco. Look out for a new version of their iOS app, coming to an App Store near you very soon.
