  Hello there. My name is Neil and I'm a Senior Director of Engineering at <a href="http://www.classpass.com/">ClassPass</a>. Previously I've worked on apps at companies like Harry's, Boiler Room, Marks & Spencers, alongside other startups in London, San Francisco, and New York.
</p>
<p>
  I'm very passionate about climate change, sustainable urban design, and technology. I'm a founding member of the <a href="https://fortgreeneopenstreets.org">Fort Greene Open Streets Coalition</a> which is dedicated to creating a safe space for pedestrians and cyclists in Brooklyn. As part of this work I've developed a <a href="/2023/09/18/introducing-street-count.html">little app for conducting street counts</a>.
